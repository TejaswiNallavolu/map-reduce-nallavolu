# Data set I chose:
## Car insurance claim dataset
- The client is a car insurance company. They want to price their car insurance competitively, which means having a good model for customers at risk of getting into accidents.
- Each row corresponds to a customer, the outcome column records whether the customer made a claim in the previous year or not. The client has informed you that the other columns should be self-explanatory.
